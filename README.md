# Challenges
This repository was built primarily to allow users to try some of the CTF challenges that I have created and learn new things from them. The process of developing these challenges also allows me to have a deeper understanding of how some of them work, which I can then apply to my future skills. The challenges will continue to expand as time goes. Please feel free to try them.
