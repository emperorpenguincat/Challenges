A particular kind of vulnerability known as "Server-Side Template Injection" (SSTI) arises when a web application displays or produces templates dynamically on the server-side without adequately validating or sanitizing user inputs prior to injecting them into the template. An attacker can run arbitrary code or access private information on the server if they have control over a portion of the template's content or structure.
