A phrase used frequently in the context of security problems, especially in Capture The Flag (CTF) contests, is "Pyjail," which is short for "Python jail". It describes a sandboxed environment in which a user has restricted access to run Python code, with safeguards in place to stop malevolent behavior.

Pyjail challenges aim to "trap" the user in a confined environment or Python interpreter, preventing them from accessing essential system resources (such as files, networking, or OS commands). The user needs to figure out how to get beyond the limitations (also known as "escaping the jail") by taking advantage of setup flaws in the environment. These flaws might be:

- Improperly sanitized input or weak input filtering.
- `__import__`, `eval()`, and `exec()` are examples of neglected Python functions or libraries that can be leveraged to get out of the sandbox.
- Access to sensitive system files or operations despite the constraints.

Pyjail challenges are essentially meant to test your skills in Python and security by having you escape or use the "jail" to accomplish a goal (such as obtaining a flag or carrying out prohibited acts).
